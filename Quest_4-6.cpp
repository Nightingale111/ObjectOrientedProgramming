/* This program takes in two integers from the user, which it then passes to
* the function called "mystery()". This function takes in integers and its return 
* type is an integer. This seems to be a recursive algorithm where the value of a
* itself does not change through each iteration, but its value is added at each step.
* The function calls itself with integers a = a and b = b - 1 until b = 1, at which
* point it returns a plus all previous iterations. 
* For example, if a = 2 and b = 4, the finished equation would be 2+(2+(2+(2))) and
* the returned final result would be 8. 
* Basically, the programmer is using recursion to add a to itself b times.
